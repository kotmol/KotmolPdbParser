PDB101 Dengue Virus July 2008 The 2r6p PDB file contains only alpha carbon atoms in the ATOM list. Normally the parser searches for guide atoms to build the backbone ribbon information. There are no other atoms in this file so this is impossible. There are also no HETATM , CONECT , HELIX or SHEET records. The current Molbrowser provides just a space filling view and Chimera defaults to just the CA chain.","title":"Special Residues"},{"location":"Special-Residues/#special-residues","text":"This is a photo log of special residues found from the PDB101 selection of atoms.
