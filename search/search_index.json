For now this is a list of special PDB files that were discovered while testing the parser. To document these unusual PDB files - screen captures will be used when interesting from the Chimera modeling system and the unreleased Molbrowser project. 2r6p \u00b6 This interesting PDB was featured in the July 2008 PDB101 article on Dengue Virus. PDB101 Dengue Virus July 2008 The 2r6p PDB file contains only alpha carbon atoms in the ATOM list. Normally the parser searches for guide atoms to build the backbone ribbon information. There are no other atoms in this file so this is impossible. There are also no HETATM , CONECT , HELIX or SHEET records. The current Molbrowser provides just a space filling view and Chimera defaults to just the CA chain. 2zoi \u00b6 This PDB structure is unusual, in that it contains Deuterium atoms. It was featured in the March 2017 PDB101 article on Photoactive Yellow Protein, specifically in the section that discusses \"Looking at the Hydrogens\". PDB101 Photoactive Yellow Protein March 2017 The clever part of this PDB is the use of heavier Deuterium atoms instead of Hydrogen atoms - and then imaging. As noted in the PDB101 entry: However, in most cases, X-ray crystallography doesn't allow us to observe the hydrogens directly. Neutrons, on the other hand, are diffracted by the nucleus of atoms, providing information on the location of hydrogen atoms. The PYP neutron diffraction structure (PDB entry 2zoi) revealed a very unusual arrangement, with a hydrogen atom shared between the chromophore and a glutamate. Here is a Chimera based snapshot showing the \"D\" atoms in positions where normally the hydrogen atoms occupy.","title":"Special Residues"},{"location":"Special-Residues/#special-residues","text":"This is a photo log of special residues found from the PDB101 selection of atoms.
