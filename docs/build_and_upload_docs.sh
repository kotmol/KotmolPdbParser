# This script clones the current repo to a temp dir
# and then builds and uploads the documentation.
# The cloned repo is left in the build/ dir as I am allergic to
# unguarded "rm -rf" commands in scripts.   The documentation
# then lives in the github repo in the "gh-pages" branch.
# 
# The documentation on Github uses the awesome mkdocs + Material facility
# kindly provided by the awesome Martin Donath (squidfunk)
# FMI:
# https://www.mkdocs.org/

#

#  Posting changes
#  1) commit and push your changes to master!!

#  script assumes you run this with the current dir in the "docs" folder
#  Prepare the script - use vim to fix line endings:
#  2)  set ff=unix
#
#  Then cd to the docs dir and run:
#  3) bash -x build_and_upload_docs.sh

#  Check the "gh-pages" branch to see the changes.

#  4) Press "Shift-F5" to reload the browser and see your changes (Chrome).
