PDB notes

### CA atoms only in model

These PDB submissions contain only CA chains and no other atoms.
This seems to be common in PDB files determined by "SOLUTION NMR" or 
"ELECTRON CRYSTALLOGRAPHY".
These PDB files have no guide atoms to position ribbons.

Examples:

* 1F6G

    MDLTYP    CA ATOMS ONLY, CHAIN A, B, C, D   
    
* 3IXZ

    MDLTYP    CA ATOMS ONLY, CHAIN A, B
