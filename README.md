The focus of the PDB work is on study of PDB files hosted by the
[RCSB][1].  Testing of the work has been carried out on a subset of
PDB files featured in the 20 years of the <b>PDB101</b> monthly 
online publication also hosted by the [RCSB][1].

- Bond information

The bond table information derives from pdbe database information, 
for example from the query:

    https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/api/pdb/compound/bonds/dg
    
For more information, see:

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/terms-of-use/

The bond table has been debugged using the PDB101 sample subset to include 
bonds not present in the EBI dataset.
